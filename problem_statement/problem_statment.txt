📝 Problem Statement

Food delivery and restaurant listing platforms contain large amounts of unstructured cuisine text data that directly influence pricing analysis, customer perception, and cuisine visibility. 
Due to inconsistent cuisine labeling, popularity bias, and regional differences, meaningful insights are often distorted. 
This project is undertaken to identify and solve the following key problems:

Regional pricing inequality across cuisines, where the same cuisine exhibits significant cost variation across different cities due to economic and cultural differences.

Perception gap between traditional and modern cuisines, where traditional cuisines may receive lower customer ratings despite offering competitive pricing.

Vote distribution bias by cuisine type, where familiar or popular cuisines attract disproportionately higher customer votes compared to less common cuisines.

Long-tail cuisine visibility problem, in which rare or niche cuisines remain underrepresented and difficult to discover due to dominance of frequently occurring cuisine labels.

Lack of identification of cuisine signatures, as restaurants offer multiple cuisine combinations that are not explicitly analyzed to uncover hidden cuisine patterns and market positioning.

Absence of a measurable cuisine diversity metric, making it difficult to compare food variety across cities and understand regional culinary richness.
